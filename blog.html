                    <p>Tell them I hate them. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting 
                        down with your children, and hitting them? It doesn't look so shiny to me. 
                        And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! 
                        I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p>
                    <p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined 
                        with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom 
                        curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… Now Fry, it's been a few years since 
                        medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</p>
                    <p>And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die 
                        like this. But I always really hoped. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your 
                        poop. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</p>

                            <p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure 
                                strength of 'will'? I'll get my kit! Throw her in the brig. Why yes! Thanks 
                                for noticing. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm 
                                factory.</p>
                            <p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold 
                                the charge and the reception isn't very… Does anybody else feel jealous and 
                                aroused and worried? No! The cat shelter's on to me.</p>
                            <p>Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Bender, I didn't know you liked 
                                cooking. That's so cute. Noooooo! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die 
                                like this. But I always really hoped. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 
                                'destroy' you!</p>
                            <p>Ummm…to eBay? Large bet on myself in round one. Ah, computer dating. It's like 
                                pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Well, let's 
                                just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.</p>
